Dataset Inventory Guidelines
=======

These guidelines are meant to help cities identify datasets that are available within departments, which is helpful for leadership and staff in all city agencies and to the public.

Conducting a data inventory can lay the foundation for a performance management program and releasing data to an open portal, but developing and maintaining a dataset inventory should also be considered a data governance best practice.
