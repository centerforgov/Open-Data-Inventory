Introduction to Dataset Inventory Guidelines
=======

Conducting a data inventory can lay the foundation for a performance management program and releasing data to an open portal, but developing and maintaining a dataset inventory should also be considered a data governance best practice. Identifying datasets that are available within departments is helpful for leadership and staff in all city agencies, and integrating public comments into the data release prioritization schedule ensures that stakeholders voices are heard.

The Center for Government Excellence recomends the following steps.

* **Step 1.** [Identify Datasets](identify-datasets.md)
* **Step 2.** [Post Inventory](post.md)
* **Step 3.** [Determine Release Schedule](release.md)

To assist cities in creating a dataset inventory, the [Center for Government Excellence at Johns Hopkins University](http://govex.jhu.edu/), a partner in the [What Works Cities initiative](http://www.whatworkscities.org/), has created these guidelines. By learning from the experiences of other cities and following best practices developed by the Center, cities will be able to identify and release high quality datasets that are valuable to city residents and other stakeholders.
