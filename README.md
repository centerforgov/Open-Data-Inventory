Dataset Inventory Guidelines
=======

These guidelines are meant to help cities identify and release high quality datasets that are valuable to city residents and other stakeholders. Conducting a data inventory can lay the foundation for a performance management program and releasing data to an open portal, but developing and maintaining a dataset inventory should also be considered a data governance best practice. Identifying datasets that are available within departments is helpful for leadership and staff in all city agencies, and integrating public comments into the data release prioritization schedule ensures that stakeholders voices are heard.

The Center for Government Excellence recomends the following steps.

* **Step 1.** [Identify Datasets](identify-datasets.md)
* **Step 1.** [Post Inventory](post.md)
* **Step 3.** [Determine Release Schedule](release.md)
