# Open-Data-Inventory

Dataset Inventory Guidelines
=======

This book is meant to help cities identify datasets that are available within departments, and that are related to the city's policy goals. This step is critical to laying the foundation for a performance management program and releasing data to an open portal, but developing and maintaining a dataset inventory should also be considered a data governance best practice. 

The steps listed here are focused on identifying datasets that relate to citywide goals, and may be expanded upon to conduct a more thorough inventory. 

The initial set of questions are meant to introduce or reinforce the concepts of open data to departments, including the shift to making data informed decisions and sharing data internally and publically. The value and quality questions are intended to help departments think through which datasets are related to citywide priorities and can help guide policy decisions and focus on the customer service experience of residents.
