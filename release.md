Determine Priority Release Schedule
=======

Once you have your list of datasets, determine the schedule for releasing datasets based on a prioritization process that incorporates public feedback. Focusing on the customer service experience of residents ensures that you are releasing what the public cares about. Rather than releasing data that you think is important, or that the public would be interested in, why not ask them!

Philadelphia has built public engagement into its [open data inventory website](http://cityofphiladelphia.github.io/slash-data/inventory/?_ga=1.247933893.332098523.1435580102), which is a detailed list of every dataset that exists wihin city government. Beside each dataset is a section in which the public can add comments.

The Data Services Team reviews the comments with each department, to help them make informed decisions on scheduling datasets for priority release. The form asks users for a name, email address, and a comment to "*Help us understand why this dataset is important to you / your community. We'll bring this back to the department for use in prioritizing their data releases.*"
