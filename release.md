Once you have your inventory, determine the schedule for releasing datasets based on a prioritization process that incorporates public feedback. Focusing on the customer service experience of residents ensures that you are releasing what the public cares about. Rather than releasing data that you think is important, or that the public would be interested in, why not ask them!
