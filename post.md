Post Inventory
=======

Once you have a list of datasets and details the next step is to post it on your website, organized by business function or agency. Include information on which datasets are published, unpublished, and in the pipeline, as well as the methodology by which you determined the release schedule, and the release schedule itself. In developing your release schedule, keep in mind any upcoming planned technology updates, new IT systems that may be coming online, or other factors that may interfere. And, keep in mind that lists may change as new IT systems come online, and priorities shift according to the realized value of the data.
