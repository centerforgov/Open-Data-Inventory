# Determine Data Value, Quality, and Availability

Use the Dataset Priority tool to rank each dataset according to its value. The questions in the tool are reproduced in the table below:

> Dataset Priority Questionnaire: Value
* Is the data related to a citywide goal and/or priority?
* Is the data related to department's mission, core function, and/or goals?
* Can the data foster cross-agency communication and collaboration?
* Does the data support policy decisions at the city or department level, or 
 contain information that could foster productive civic engagement and policy debate?
* Is the data regularly  or frequently requested by public through Right to Know, FOIA, or 311?
Could availability of the data create specific economic opportunity?
* Does the data have a direct impact on the public? (e.g., hospital infection rates, food establishment inspection results, etc.).
* Is the data of timely interest? (related to current events, new initiatives, etc.)

____
>Dataset Priority Questionnaire: Quality
* Does the data have depth and breadth of years of coverage?
* Does the data have accompanying metadata and a data dictionary? 
* Is the data available at the most granular level?
* Is the data accurate/complete?

_____
> Dataset Priority Questionnaire: Readiness/Availability
* Is the data available to the public with no access restrictions and no cost?
* Is the dataset in a format that is machine-readable or can be easily transformed? 
* Is the data currently online?

Once each dataset is ranked, group them into priority categories according to score, as shown in the shaded box below. Schedule datasets with higher rankings for publication before datasets with lower rankings, understanding that planned technology updates and other factors may interfere. The lists may change as new IT systems come online, and priorities shift according to the realized value of the data.


Publish your published datasets, unpublished datasets, and datasets that are in the pipeline, as well as the methodology by which you determined the schedule.
