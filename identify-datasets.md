# Work with Departments to Identify Datasets

Before you begin down the path of conducting a data inventory, ensure that leaders from each department understand the importance of uncovering their data assets. Setting up individudal meetings with department heads and deputy mayors can provide an opportunity to share information on open data concepts, joint data sharing, and sensitive/confidential data awarenes, while gathering feedback and concerns about the process and getting a sense of how easy it may be to work with each agency. The data inventory process can feel daunting, so consider starting with a few targeted agencies based on their understanding and enthusiasm for the project, as well as relevance to strategic priorities or performance management goals.

Once you have a sense of buy-in, ask each department to designate a point of contact (POC). You may wish to identify a lead analyst or researcher, preferably within the Mayor’s office, to interact with departments and facilitate this process. The lead will share the following prompts with department POCs, and will collect and catalog responses using the template found in Appendix A.

The set of questions below is meant to help agencies think about the data they use in their day to day jobs, and the information that is critical to their processes, so that they can list the datasets that they use.

> To determine which datasets to submit, please consider the following questions:

>* Do you have any of the datasets listed in the “Open Data Quick Start Datasets” tool kit?
* Of the data that you regularly create, maintain, or manage, what is directly related to citywide goals or priorities?
* Which datasets are related to your department’s mission? Consider your departments strategic plan, any existing goals or performance objectives, your department’s website, and any regular reports.
* What data is regularly or frequently requested through Right to Know requests, FOIA requests, or 311 requests?
* What data is used in performance-based budgeting or evaluation (if applicable)?
* What data is used to compile reports for a legislative body (city council or cabinet meeting)?
* What data is used for reports on federal, state, or nonprofit grants?
* What data is used to record a measurement or transaction, and/or provides information on government services, initiatives or resources?
* Are there datasets that drive lists, tables, graphs, charts, maps, or other visualizations that your department uses?
