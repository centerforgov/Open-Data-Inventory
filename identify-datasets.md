# Step 1. Identify Datasets

####Before you begin...
Ensure that leaders from each department understand the importance of uncovering their data assets. Setting up individual meetings with department heads and deputy mayors can provide an opportunity to share information on open data concepts, joint data sharing, and sensitive/confidential data awareness, while helping you gather feedback and concerns about the process, and get a sense of how easy it may be to work with each agency. The data inventory process can feel daunting, so consider starting with a few targeted agencies based on their understanding and enthusiasm for the project, as well as relevance to strategic priorities or performance management goals.

####Once you have a sense of buy-in...
Ask each department to designate a point of contact (POC). You may wish to identify a lead analyst or researcher, preferably within the Mayor’s office, to interact with departments and facilitate this process. The lead will share the following prompts with department POCs, and will collect and catalog responses using the template found in [Appendix A](appendix-a.md).

####Next, unpack your data assests
To begin, you may wish to use the [sample datasets](index.md) in subsequent chapters to determine whether you have data in the categories that relate to your strategic priorities, performance management goals, and departmental mission.

The questions below are meant to help agencies think about the data they use in their day to day jobs, and the information that is critical to their processes, so that they can list the datasets that they use.

>**Of the data that you regularly create, maintain, or manage, which datatsets are....**
* Directly related to citywide goals or priorities?
* Related to your department’s mission? Consider your departments strategic plan, any existing goals or performance objectives, your department’s website, and any regular reports.
* Regularly or frequently requested through Right to Know requests, FOIA requests, or 311 requests?
* Used in performance-based budgeting or evaluation (if applicable)?
* Used to compile reports for a legislative body (city council or cabinet meeting)?
* Used for reports on federal, state, or nonprofit grants?
* Used to record a measurement or transaction, and/or provides information on government services, initiatives or resources?
* Drive lists, tables, graphs, charts, maps, or other visualizations that your department uses?
