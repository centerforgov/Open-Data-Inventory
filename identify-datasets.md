# Work with Departments to Identify Datasets

Work with each department to identify a point of contact (POC). 
Identify an analyst or researcher, preferably within the Mayor’s office, who will interact with departments and facilitate this process.
The Mayor’s office lead should meet with department POCs to share information on open data concepts, joint data sharing, and sensitive/confidential data awareness, as well as to understand any data challenges. The initial meeting may be held with all departments POCs, or individually.


During the initial meeting, consider establishing a timeframe by which the initial inventory must be started and completed.
The lead will share the following prompts with department POCs, and will collect and catalog responses using the GovEx tool.
